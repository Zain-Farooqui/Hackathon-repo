This readme file is created to replicate the prototype working.

I integrated the IBM Watson assistant's script in Index.html file. 

Project idea: Idea is to resolve employee's queries by providing them the information that they need. In this way most of the queries wouldn't go to the HR and HR can focus on their important tasks. This solution also helps employee to get instant answers without waiting for the response from HR and HR also get relief from the FAQs.

You can use this solution by simply opening index.html file. You will then see in right bottom corner a message will pop up. There you can chat with the Watson assistant.
